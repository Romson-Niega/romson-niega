â€¢	Managed and secured LA Countyâ€™s perimeter firewalls, safeguarding sensitive data across DMZ and internal networks. Configured firewall rules, routes, and S2S VPN connections, maintaining optimal network security and performance. 

â€¢	Developed and implemented security policies using Palo Altoâ€™s Panorama, Ciscoâ€™s FMC, and ASA to regulate traffic between security zones, enhancing network segmentation by 100% and ensuring robust protection. 

â€¢	Partnered with the Networking Team to implement static routes, enabling customers to securely access data within ISD data centers. Improved customer connectivity by 20% for accessing programs and applications hosted in AWS, GPC, and OCM. 

â€¢	Deployed and managed IPS technologies using Ciscoâ€™s Talos Threat Source and IPS sensors to detect and prevent network intrusions under the mandate of the Department Information Security Officer. Improved access to intranet servers and   resolved hanging DNS sessions by implementing a fast path for the IPS on the firewall.  

â€¢	Led Level 1 and 2 firewall troubleshooting efforts, conducting trace-route and packet capture analysis to diagnose vendor network issues, successfully identifying a floating IP caused by the vendorâ€™s load balancer. 

â€¢	Enhanced business continuity plans by developing and refining standard operating procedures for firewalls, including the creation of disaster-specific security policies with pre-approved critical ports. Trained new hires on the firewall (SOP).  

â€¢	Monitored firewall performance, traffic volume, and alerts using Elasticsearch, PRTG, and Palo Altoâ€™s Strata, proactively mitigating potential security threats. 

â€¢	Generated and delivered comprehensive reports on firewall activities, including attack statistics, malware interceptions, and system health. Successfully eliminated the need for third-party vendors, reducing departmental costs by 50% annually.
